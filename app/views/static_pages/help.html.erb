      <strong>DisDev</strong> is a web app based on the needs to develop on the Scrum way.<br>
      <strong>Scrum</strong> is an iterative and incremental agile software development methodology
      for managing product development. It defines "a flexible, holistic product
      development strategy where a development team works as a unit to reach a common goal",
      challenges assumptions of the "traditional,
      sequential approach" to product development, and enables teams to
      self-organize by encouraging physical co-location or close online collaboration
      of all team members, as well as daily face-to-face communication among
      all team members and disciplines in the project.

      A key principle of scrum is its recognition that during a project
      the customers can change their minds about what they want and need
      (often called "requirements churn"), and that unpredicted challenges
      cannot be easily addressed in a traditional predictive or planned manner.
      As such, scrum adopts an empirical approachâ€”accepting that the problem
      cannot be fully understood or defined, focusing instead on maximizing
      the team's ability to deliver quickly and respond to emerging requirements.
